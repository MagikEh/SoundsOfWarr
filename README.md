# SoundsOfWarr is a collection of sounds for games
These sounds have been made specifically with [NodeCore](https://gitlab.com/sztest/nodecore/tree/master) in mind. Each node will have a few specific sounds associated with it including:
 * Hitting the block (May seperate this out into pummeling, packing, and breaking where each is a step of force above the last)
 * The block Breaking
 * The block Landing
 * The block being walked on
 * Associated Ambient sound(s)

---
The general organization (for now) is a simple folder per node with all associated sounds therein.
